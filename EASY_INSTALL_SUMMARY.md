- Health checks and error detection

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Docker Optimizations
- Multi-stage build for smaller image size
- `.dockerignore` for faster builds
- Health checks for container monitoring
- Proper volume mounting for data persistence

### User Experience
- Clear error messages with installation links
- Colored output and progress indicators
- Menu-driven interface selection
- Automatic Docker status checking

### Security & Isolation
- Containerized execution environment
- Network isolation with custom networks
- Volume-based data persistence
- Non-root user execution where possible

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Manual Installation)
1. Install Python 3.8+
2. Install pip dependencies
3. Install system tools (nmap, netcat, etc.)
4. Configure database
5. Handle OS-specific issues
6. Troubleshoot dependency conflicts

**Time**: 15-30 minutes + troubleshooting

### After (Docker Installation)
1. Install Docker (one-time setup)
2. Run quick-start script
3. Choose interface mode
4. Start using C-Keeper

**Time**: 30 seconds (after Docker is installed)
